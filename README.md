# South Africa industry classification systems

Industry codes, labels and concordance tables from "[Industry classification in the South African tax microdata](https://sa-tied.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/SA-TIED-WP-134.pdf)" with Amina Ebrahim.
It is recommended that you read the paper if you use these tables. Please cite the paper if you use the tables.

The concordance tables come from a combination of official sources and our own hand-matching (discussed in the paper). Use at your own risk: we accept no liability for any errors.

Key:
- `act` = SARS Activity Codes
- `prof` = SARS Profit Codes
- `sic5` = Statistics South Africa Standard Industrial Classification, edition 5
- `sic7` = Statistics South Africa Standard Industrial Classification, edition 7 (similar to ISIC-4)

The following two files come directly from correspondence with Stats SA. They too should be used at your own risk:
- `SIC edition_5 and SIC edition_7 correspondence table V1.00.xls`
- `Changes between SIC 7 and ISIC 4.docx`
